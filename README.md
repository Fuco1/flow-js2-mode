# flow-js2-mode

This package adds support for [Flow](https://flow.org/), a static typechecking extension for javascript, to [js2-mode](https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode), a popular javascript editing mode for Emacs.

This project is heavily WIP at the moment, things might break and change.  Please report all the issues, even minor ones so we can polish this as soon as possible.

# Usage

Enable `flow-js2-minor-mode` in the `js2-mode` buffer.
